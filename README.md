# The Tech Shop

Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Stripe, Commerce.js

This was my first time learning my way around Stripe and Commerce.js. Both were really intuitive and easy to pick up. The utility of using Commerce.js's own API to host the clients information was amazing. No need for a back-end, engineer upkeep, or any of the sort! All options/ site handling is directly responsible in the client's hands.

To test out our site: Once at your cart and you fill out all available information. When you select which payment method to use, Stripe allows us to use a demo card to test with.

Card Number: 4242-42424-424242-4242

MM/YY-CVC-Zip: 04/24-242-42424

Or if that doesnt work just fill out "42" over and over again till there is no more room.

## Optimizations

As one of my more fuller projects, i cant wait to revisit some day and optimize my code the best i can. Maybe down the line, we can come in and build our own more expansive back-end. Including adding Auth/Sessions

## Lessons Learned:

There are multiple of options available to engineers, and designers in order to fit their client's needs. Whether its just front-end or full-stack completely; it is our job to find the best available tools to meet the job.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
